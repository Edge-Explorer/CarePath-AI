üê≥ Docker Commands

To save your Docker image locally (from your machine):

docker save -o carepath-ai.tar carepath-ai:latest


To load the Docker image on another machine:

docker load -i carepath-ai.tar


‚úÖ The docker load command only loads the image. To run the container:

docker run -it --rm carepath-ai:latest


‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure Docker is installed on the host machine before running these commands.

‚ö° Important Notes About Reasoning

The CarePath-AI system consists of two main components:

Random Forest (RF) model (model.pkl) ‚Äì Provides confidence scores based on patient features.

Ollama LLM for RAG ‚Äì Provides reasoning and detailed explanations.

If Ollama is not running on the host machine, the container will still provide the RF confidence score, but the reasoning section will not appear.

To enable full reasoning, make sure Ollama is installed and the required models are pulled:

ollama pull llama3
ollama pull mistral

üìù Summary

Download the dataset from Kaggle or Google Drive.

Load the Docker image using docker load -i carepath-ai.tar.

Run the container with docker run -it --rm carepath-ai:latest.

Ensure Ollama is running to get both confidence and reasoning.

Without Ollama, you will still get confidence scores from the RF model.
